            The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. I find your
            lack of faith disturbing. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't
            know, what do you think? Ye-ha! He is here. What!?
          </p>
          <p>
            What?! He is here. I'm trying not to, kid. But with the blast shield
            down, I can't even see!{" "}
            <strong> How am I supposed to fight?</strong>{" "}

            As you wish. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing
            for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a
            Jedi, like my father before me. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
            flowing through him.

              Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy
              mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship
              by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they
              sent you.

          <h3>
            I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for
            this sort of thing.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the
            Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now.
            It's such a long way from here. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance
            and a traitor! Take her away!

            <li>Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. I need your help,
            Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of
            thing. Don't underestimate the Force. Oh God, my uncle. How am I
            ever gonna explain this?
          </p>
          <p>
            Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for
            you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.
            Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy
            mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by
            Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent
            you.

          <p>
            Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?
            Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that
            all on board were killed. What good is a reward if you ain't around
            to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of
            courage. It's more like…suicide.
          </p>
          <p>
            I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious
            self and act on instinct. She must have hidden the plans in the
            escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it
            personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!
          </p>
          <p>
            What?! Partially, but it also obeys your commands. A tremor in the
            Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
            Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

            Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I want to come with you to
            Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways
            of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Don't

            Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen
            a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me
            believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything.
            There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all
            a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. You mean it controls your
            actions?
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here
            now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my
            father before me. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is
            my only link to finding their secret base.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm trying not to, kid. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing
            and go home! Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do
            you think? I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of
            the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--
          </p>
          <p>
            Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster
            at your side, kid. What!? You mean it controls your actions?
            Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I want to come with you
            to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the
            ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.
